- 💻  &nbsp; I’m currently working at - [Kiva](kiva.org). Kiva is a non-profit that empowers underserved people to achieve their dreams by crowdfunding loans and unlocking capital. Our front end code is open source. [Kiva - UI](https://github.com/kiva/ui).

- 🧗  &nbsp; I have a side project - [SizeSquirrel](sizesquirrel.com). SizeSquirrel crowd-sources climbing shoe sizing data to find users their size for shoes they don't have. It also finds deals on climbing shoes and recommends climbing shoes. It's also open source: [SizeSquirrel - Open Source](https://github.com/eddieferrer/sizesquirrel-open).
